# Atheer Portfolio 🚀

**Atheer** is a premium, cinematic portfolio platform built with Next.js. It's designed to showcase developer talent with a high-end "Glow & Glass" aesthetic, inspired by modern design standards like those of Brittany Chiang.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Cinematic UI**: Smooth entry animations using Framer Motion and a signature "Spotlight" mouse-tracking effect.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Multiple color themes (Teal, Ruby, Emerald, etc.) that persist across sessions.
- **Glassmorphic Design**: Modern, semi-transparent surfaces with consistent visual depth.
- **Data-Driven Architecture**: Content is separated from logic using typed static-data files, ready for future CMS integration.
- **Performance Optimized**: Tree-shakeable icons, optimized fonts, and minimal client-side weight.
