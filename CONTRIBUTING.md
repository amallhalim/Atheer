### 2. Suggesting Enhancements
- **Open an issue**: Explain the feature you'd like to see, why it's useful, and how it fits into the "Glow & Glass" aesthetic.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup
Make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/atheer.git
cd atheer
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Branching Strategy
- **`main`**: The stable branch.
- **`feature/xxx`**: For new features.
- **`fix/xxx`**: For bug fixes.
- **`docs/xxx`**: For documentation updates.

### 3. Coding Standards
- **TypeScript**: All new code must be fully typed.
- **Tailwind**: Use theme variables (e.g., `text-primary`) instead of static hex codes.
- **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` before committing to ensure code quality.
