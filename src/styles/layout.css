    /* --- Visual & Interaction Rules --- */
    
    /* 1. INTERACTION: 'pointer-events-none' (The "Invisible Glass")
          What: Makes the element "click-through."
          Why: Allows clicking elements underneath the spotlight layer. 
          Summary: If you click here, the browser ignores the spotlight and clicks the content behind it. */
    
    /* 2. POSITION: 'fixed' (The "Glasses" Analogy)
          What: Pins it to the browser window (viewport).
          Why: Mouse coordinates (clientX/Y) are relative to the window. 
          If we used 'absolute', the light would "scroll away" when you move down the page. */
    
    /* 3. SIZING: 'inset-0' (The "4-Way Anchor")
          What: Pins all 4 sides to the edges of the window, forcing the box to stretch full-screen.
          Analogy: It tells the browser "I want to touch all 4 walls of my home at the same time." */
    
    /* 4. LAYERING: 'z-30' places it on a middle layer—above the background but below menus/popups. */
