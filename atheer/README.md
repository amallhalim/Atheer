This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

### Linting & Code Quality

To check for code errors, unused imports, or stylistic issues, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

**Why use it?**
- **Catch Bugs early**: Identifies common mistakes (like unescaped characters in JSX).
- **Clean Code**: Flags unused variables and imports.
- **Consistency**: Ensures the code follows the project's standards.
- **Pre-deployment check**: It's recommended to run this before committing or deploying to ensure everything is correct.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
