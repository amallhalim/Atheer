    /* --- Visual & Interaction Rules --- */
    
    /* 1. INTERACTION: 'pointer-events-none' (The "Invisible Glass")
          What: Makes the element "click-through."
          Why: Since the spotlight covers the screen, without this, you couldn't click buttons underneath. 
          It tells the browser: "Ignore me and click the thing behind me." */
    
    /* 2. POSITION: 'fixed' (The "Glasses" Analogy)
          What: Pins it to the browser window (viewport).
          Why: Mouse coordinates (clientX/Y) are relative to the window, not the page. 
          If we used 'absolute' or the body size, the light would "scroll away" and get lost. 
          'fixed' ensures the canvas always sits perfectly in front of your eyes. */
    
    /* 3. SIZING: 'inset-0' (The "4-Way Anchor")
          What: Pins all 4 sides to the edges of the window, forcing the box to stretch full-screen.
          Analogy: It tells the browser "I want to touch all 4 walls of my home at the same time." */
    
    /* 4. LAYERING: 'z-30' places it on a middle layer—above the background but below menus/popups. */
        
    @apply pointer-events-none fixed inset-0 z-30 transition-opacity duration-300;
