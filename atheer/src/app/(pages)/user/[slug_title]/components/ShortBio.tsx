                I’m a frontend engineer with 3+ years of professional experience, primarily working with React and modern JavaScript to build production-ready web applications.

                I’ve worked in a software house environment where I contributed to multiple client and internal projects. My work focuses on translating designs into high-quality user interfaces, improving performance, and ensuring applications are scalable and easy to maintain.

                I collaborate closely with designers, backend engineers, and product teams, and I have experience mentoring junior developers, conducting code reviews, and working within Agile teams. I’m always improving my skills and learning new tools to stay aligned with modern frontend best practices.
